# Predicting housing prices in Buenos Aires - Properati Data 
## Brief description of the project  Outline: defining the structure and objetive of the project
##Data cleaning and transformation: checking to see the integrity of the data, treating of outliers and null values, data scaling as well as  defining which data points will be useful for this project. Use of simple models (Descision Tree) to check the performance on the clean data set
##Using advanced models to improve the benchmark performance: We import and try advanced models to improve the quality of the results with the dataset, these models are XGBoost, Random Forest, ADABoost, polinomial regressor, Bagging with  Decision Tree regressor, lineal regression
##Comparing of results and conclusions: Check the results of each model to choose the best one, and study the variables that made the most impact in the performance of said model.
